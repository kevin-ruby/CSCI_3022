Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.

Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",

    "In this problem you will write some code to simulate the game of **Miniopoly** (a very rough approximation of [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)).  The game consists of a round board with 40 \"squares\" numbered from $0$ to $39$, where squares $0$ and would-be $40$ are [coincident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincident) and called **GO**.  A player starts on **GO** with \\\\$200 in their pocket.  On each turn the player rolls a pair of dice and then moves a number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.  Landing on different squares have different results: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 3, 7, 15, 22, 33, and 36 cause you to draw a card.  The cards tell you to collect either \\\\$50 or \\\\$250 or pay the bank \\\\$50.  There is always an equal probability associated with each of these possible cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Squares 0, 10, and 20 do not trigger any action \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Square 30 is **Go To Jail**, which sends the player directly to **Jail** and ends the turn \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a player starts a turn from **Jail** she rolls two dice: \n",

    "    - If the player rolls anything other than doubles she pays the bank \\$20 and remains in **Jail** \n",

Note that if a player goes bankrupt during the game you should return their cash as 0 instead of a negative value.  "
